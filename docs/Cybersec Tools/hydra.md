# Hydra

Hydra is a brute force online password cracking program, a quick system login password “hacking” tool.

## Hydra Commands
The options we pass into Hydra depend on which service (protocol) we’re attacking. For example, to brute force FTP with the username being `user` and a password list being `passlist.txt`, we’d use the following command:

`hydra -l user -P passlist.txt ftp://IP`

Commands to use Hydra on SSH and a web form (POST method).

### SSH

`hydra -l <username> -P <full path to pass> MACHINE_IP -t 4 ssh`

|Option|	Description|
|-|-|
|-l|	specifies the (SSH) username for login|
|-P|	indicates a list of passwords|
|-t|	sets the number of threads to spawn|

For example, `hydra -l root -P passwords.txt MACHINE_IP -t 4 ssh` will run with the following arguments:

- Hydra will use root as the username for ssh
- It will try the passwords in the passwords.txt file
- There will be four threads running in parallel as indicated by -t 4

### Post Web Form

We can use Hydra to brute force web forms too. You must know which type of request it is making; GET or POST methods are commonly used. You can use your browser’s network tab (in developer tools) to see the request types or view the source code.

`sudo hydra <username> <wordlist> IP http-post-form "<path>:<login_credentials>:<invalid_response>"`

| Option | Description |
|-|-|
|-l| the username for (web form) login |
|-P| the password list to use |
|http-post-form|the type of the form is POST|
|\<path>|the login page URL, for example, login.php|
|\<login_credentials>|the username and password used to log in, for example, username=^USER^&password=^PASS^|
|\<invalid_response>|part of the response when the login fails|
|-V|verbose output for every attempt|

Below is a more concrete example Hydra command to brute force a POST login form:

`hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> IP http-post-form "/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -V`

- The login page is only /, i.e., the main IP address.
- The username is the form field where the username is entered
- The specified username(s) will replace ^USER^
- The password is the form field where the password is entered
- The provided passwords will be replacing ^PASS^
- Finally, F=incorrect is a string that appears in the server reply when the login fails
